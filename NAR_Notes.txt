TODO:
- If actually publishing, consider monetisation model?
	- Unlockable skins
	- Collectibles function as currency
		- If collectibles change color with the environment, different color collectibles could function
		  as separate currencies, forcing the player to gather at leas a few collectibles at the
		  higher speeds (environment color is tied to speed) 
	- Player can watch adds to earn extra currency (x2 currency for the next three games)
	- Buying the full version halves the skin costs
- Proper effects on all actions
	- Collecting collectable
	- Activating shield
	- Dashing
	- Hitting an obstacle
	- Obstacle getting destroyed (by the player shield / collectable spawn)
	- Player death
	- Enemy spawning
	- Enemy starting charge
	- Enemy ending charge / starting attack
	- Enemy ending attack
	- Enemy getting destroyed (by the player trail)
- Proper menu textures
- Proper player ship model
- Implement main menu
	- Play (goal reached at the end of the song)
	- Endless mode (the music loops, continues endlessly)
	- Customization (Can buy and select skins for the player ship. Bought with ingame currency)
	- Options (PC: Volume, Resolution) 
	- (Credits)
	- Quit (Exits the application)
	- Background scene with the ship speeding through the game environment
- Change color on all text and menus according to environment
- Implement goal reaching
- Jump? (can jump over spawning obstacles)
- Tie background music to speed (change to faster paced music at certain speed multipliers)?
- Obstacle spawn rate follows audio bpm
- Alternate collectibles
	- Timed invulnerability with flashing environment colors
	- Mirrored world
- Obstacle color lerp from white to environment color while running spawn animation
- Increase player movement speed by increasing timescale, instead of various variables in script?
	- This would ensure similar obstacle spawning even at higher speeds
	- Possible problems
	- Too difficult?
- Proper trail implementation
	- Fix player trail gaps
	- Trail segment pooling
	- Reconsider creating trail mesh in script and modifying mesh vertex position to fake movement
- Playtest and tweak enemies
	- Should they be destroyable at all?
	- Currently just an annoyance
	- Does the feature bring any new value to the gameplay
- Add speed multiplier tiers to 50-60
- Bloom glow with audio
- Input button opacity decreases as the level proggresses (attach to score or scoreMultiplier value)
	- This way the player is reminded of the button positions at the start of the level, but the buttons
	  still get out of the way of visibility shortly after


DONE:
- Color changes slower (creates "chapters" within the level = feel of progression)
- Make the trail segments with cubes instead of quads
- Intro skipping
- Find license free music!
- Dash / barrelroll
- Score multiplier = hp against obstacles
- Update the trail with coroutines
- Increase player y-position and modify obstacle colliders to move with the obstacle visuals
- Tie color change to speed?
- Collectibles switch colors to complementary colors of the environment (from RGB colors)
- Enemies 
	- (Shoot at player, if hit, player loses score. Destroyed when colliding with the player trail.)
	- Enemies have proper charging indication
	- After charging, enemies charge forward and leave a trail behind
	- The trail damages player if collided with
- Display song name at the intro?
- Fix enemy movement and player following
- Indicate score multiplier timer to the player somehow (horiozontal color change on the score field)
- Increase collectible despawner area size with speed multiplier
- Collectible marker does not disappear when the collectible is collected
- Indicate invulnerability to the player somehow (shield around the player)
- Redesign score system (don't count core, display only speed multiplier and the amount of collected 
	collectables)
- Change score text fill / background color with the environment colors
- Test alternate grid implementations to fix the grid line visual jittering 
	- Standard shader with texture tested (is worse)
- Display song name in the pause menu?
- Fix the gaps in enemy attack obstacle spawn line
