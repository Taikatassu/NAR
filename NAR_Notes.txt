TODO:
- Update the trail with coroutines
- Enemies (Shoot at player, if hit, player loses score. Destroyed when colliding with the player trail.)
- Score = hp agains enemies
- Color lerp: change hue instead of using Color.Lerp
- Bloom glow with audio
- Jump? (can jump over spawning obstacles)
- Tie color change to speed?
- Tie background music to speed (change to faster paced music at certain speed multipliers)?

DONE:
- Color changes slower (creates "chapters" within the level = feel of progression)
- Make the trail segments with cubes instead of quads
- Intro skipping
- Find license free music!
- Dash / barrelroll
- Score multiplier = hp against obstacles
