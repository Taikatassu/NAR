TODO:
- Color lerp: change hue instead of using Color.Lerp
- Bloom glow with audio
- Jump? (can jump over spawning obstacles)
- Tie background music to speed (change to faster paced music at certain speed multipliers)?
- If actually publishing, consider monetisation model?
	- Unlockable skins
	- Collectibles function as currency
		- If collectibles change color with the environment, different color collectibles could function
		  as separate currencies, forcing the player to gather at leas a few collectibles at the
		  higher speeds (environment color is tied to speed) 
	- Player can watch adds to earn extra currency (x2 currency for the next three games)
	- Buying the full version halves the skin costs
- Obstacle spawn rate follows audio bpm
- Input button opacity decreases as the level proggresses (attach to score or scoreMultiplier value)
	- This way the player is reminded of the button positions at the start of the level, but the buttons
	  still get out of the way of visibility shortly after
- Indicate score multiplier timer to the player somehow (horiozontal color change on the score field)
- Indicate invulnerability to the player somehow (shield around the player)
- Increase collectible despawner area size with speed multiplier
- Update enemy attack obstacle spawning in a coroutine (instead of update loop)
- Fix player trail gaps
- Trail segment pooling
- Display song name in the pause menu?


DONE:
- Color changes slower (creates "chapters" within the level = feel of progression)
- Make the trail segments with cubes instead of quads
- Intro skipping
- Find license free music!
- Dash / barrelroll
- Score multiplier = hp against obstacles
- Update the trail with coroutines
- Increase player y-position and modify obstacle colliders to move with the obstacle visuals
- Tie color change to speed?
- Collectibles switch colors to complementary colors of the environment (from RGB colors)
- Enemies 
	- (Shoot at player, if hit, player loses score. Destroyed when colliding with the player trail.)
	- Enemies have proper charging indication
	- After charging, enemies charge forward and leave a trail behind
	- The trail damages player if collided with
- Display song name at the intro?
- Fix enemy movement and player following
