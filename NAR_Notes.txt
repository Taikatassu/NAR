TODO:
- Update the trail with coroutines
- Score multiplier = hp against obstacles
- Score = hp agains enemies
- Color lerp: change hue instead of using Color.Lerp
- Bloom glow with audio
- Jump? (can jump over spawning obstacles)
- Dash / barrelroll

DONE:
- Color changes slower (creates "chapters" within the level = feel of progression)
- Make the trail segments with cubes instead of quads
- Intro skipping
