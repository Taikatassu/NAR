TODO:
- Enemies 
	- (Shoot at player, if hit, player loses score. Destroyed when colliding with the player trail.)
	- Enemies have proper charging indication
	- After charging, enemies charge forward and leave a trail behind
	- The trail damages player if collided with
- Score = hp agains enemies
- Color lerp: change hue instead of using Color.Lerp
- Bloom glow with audio
- Jump? (can jump over spawning obstacles)
- Tie color change to speed?
- Tie background music to speed (change to faster paced music at certain speed multipliers)?
- If actually publishing, consider monetisation model?
	- Unlockable skins
	- Collectibles function as currency
	- Player can watch adds to earn extra currency (x2 currency for the next three games)
	- Buying the full version halves the skin costs
- Obstacle spawn rate follows audio bpm
- Collectibles switch colors to complementary colors of the environment (from RGB colors)


DONE:
- Color changes slower (creates "chapters" within the level = feel of progression)
- Make the trail segments with cubes instead of quads
- Intro skipping
- Find license free music!
- Dash / barrelroll
- Score multiplier = hp against obstacles
- Update the trail with coroutines
